## ⚙️ Workflow Summary

| Step | Node | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|
| 1️⃣ | **Manual Trigger** | Starts the workflow when “Execute Workflow” is pressed — ideal for controlled campaign launches. |
| 2️⃣ | **Google Sheets (Dataset Input)** | Pulls data from `Texas_Municipal_Contacts_500.csv` (Sheet: `Civic_Pulse_140`). Each row represents a potential contact. |
| 3️⃣ | **Filter** | Keeps only rows where `ExistingClient = N` — ensures outreach only to new leads. |
| 4️⃣ | **Gmail** | Sends personalized invitations with each contact’s **name**, **county**, and **organization**, including a dynamic Google Form link. |
| 5️⃣ | **Google Sheets (Form Responses)** | Reads responses from the **demo-interest form** to track engagement in real time. |
