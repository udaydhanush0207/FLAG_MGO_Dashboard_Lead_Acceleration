---

## Objective  
Build trust and visibility at the **MyGovernmentOnline (MGO) User Conference**, turning FLAG’s single-client success story into a statewide credibility campaign that attracts at least **5 new clients** by early 2026.

---

## Core Concept: “Voices of Transparency” Podcast  

**Idea:**  
Turn FLAG’s existing client into a storytelling asset. We can record a **10–15 minute video podcast** that showcases how the Civic Pulse Dashboard improved their visibility, efficiency, and accountability and paying the client around 50$~100$ for that video if they are okay to tell.  

**Execution:**  
- We will record using Riverside.fm.
- I will Edit in **CapCut or Canva** — by adding FLAG logo, captions, outro slide.
- Then, will export 1–2 short vertical clips (30–60 sec) for LinkedIn and pre-conference buzz.  
- We Hhst full version on YouTube and embed **QR codes** into booth banners, giveaways, and emails.  
- And the we integrate this link into the **Google Form** used at the event (“Book your free Civic Pulse demo”).  

**Result:**  
A genuine testimonial that sells credibility without cold marketing — authentic, relatable, and visual.

## Booth Demo Flow  

### 1️⃣ Visual First  
A looping TV video displays:  
- Civic Pulse Dashboard (Looker Studio demo)  
- Client podcast highlights  
- Blitz.ai outreach teaser animation  

### 2️⃣ QR Scan Funnel  
Visitors scan the booth QR to open:  
> “Schedule a free Civic Pulse demo for your county.”  

Data feeds into Google Sheets → n8n → CRM tracking.

### 3️⃣ Live Walkthrough  
Team shows a **before vs after** from MGO raw exports → FLAG dashboards.  
It’s quick, visual, and designed for non-technical decision-makers.

---

## Strategic Edge  

### Why This Matters  
Most county officials still rely on static Excel or PDF reports.  
FLAG’s dashboard shows **live operational metrics** in seconds — a major competitive edge over static consulting reports.  

**This approach does three things:**  
1. Builds emotional credibility through a client’s real voice.  
2. Converts booth traffic into measurable leads.  
3. Positions FLAG as a data-first partner, not just a consulting vendor.

---

## Supporting Strategy  

### 🔹 Pre-Conference Buzz  
LinkedIn teaser post — “We’re bringing real stories of data transparency to the MGO Conference.”  
Attach podcast clip + dashboard preview thumbnail.

### 🔹 During Event  
Collect attendee names and badge scans → auto-log via **n8n workflow** → send thank-you email with dashboard link + form to schedule a call.

### 🔹 Post-Event Follow-Up  
Send customized follow-up emails to top 30 engaged officials within 7 days.
